name: Screw Process Anomaly Visualization (SPAV)
description: |-
  Following the Industrial Revolutions 4.0 and 5.0, the assembly industry faces mounting pressure to reduce costs and boost efficiency using AI‑driven solutions. Modern screwdriver systems generate real‑time angle‑torque data that form tightening curves, which must be frequently recalibrated and inspected to prevent defective assemblies. We propose modeling normal screwing profiles with unsupervised AutoEncoders to detect deviations indicative of faults, complemented by intuitive visual analytics. Our Python module, Screw Process Anomaly Visualization (SPAV), offers four key plots—Global Error, Local Error, Detected Anomalies, and Anomaly Density via KDE—to support operators in understanding and validating anomaly detection. PAV integrates seamlessly with the Scientific Python ecosystem and is compatible with H2O and Keras AE models.
